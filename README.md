## About
This repositry __aims__ to provide a thorough guide to building drones.
- In case you're new to this domain:
  1. the section [__Introduction to drones__]() provides an execelent
resource for starters who want to __understand__ core concepts related to drones and quadcopters in particular.

  2. after getting familiar with core concepts, you can check the section [__Code documentation__]()
for thorough explanation of code implementation for Arduino\ESP32 microcontrollers.

  3. finally, head to the [__Building a quadcopter from A to Z__]() section for a thorough guide on how to build
a drone. (it's not necessary to have the same component used in the guide and source code).
